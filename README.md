# Gab Dissenter Lite Extension
Dissenter Light is the minimalist way to get to the comment section of the Internet.

I really miss having a Dissenter plugin since I love having the ability to comment on almost any content on the Internet, so I made this simple extension that allows you to do just that, in a super small lightweight package.

I just wanted to keep it simple, so it'd be easy for just about anyone to see what it does and how it works.
# How To Use
Simply browse to any URI, then click the Dissenter Lite icon. This should take you to the Dissenter discussion for the URI. Simply log in and you'll be able to join the discussion.

#How To Side-load Install (Edge Chromium, but Chrome is similar)
1) Select the **Code** button.
2) Select **Download ZIP** and extract to a nice home.
3) [Manage Edge Extensions] (edge://extensions/).
4) Turn on **Developer mode**.
5) Select **Load unpacked** and navigate to the folder containing manifest.js for this extension (from the ZIP you downloaded in step 2 above).
6) The Dissenter Lite icon should be visible in your extensions - ready for action!
# Future features
1) Open page in a PopUp window instead of redirecting the page.
2) Show a gleam over the icon if comments exist for the current tab URI.
